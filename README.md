# MidiKeyboardBluePill
This is software for the STM32F103 Microcontroller to convert serial midi into the outputs that would be generated by the Hybrid Music 4000 keyboard for the BBC Micro and BBC Master.

A BluePill board, plus optocoupler circuit is all that is required to get this to work. A complete hardware design will be forthcoming.
